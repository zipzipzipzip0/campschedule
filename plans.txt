This is an unorganized list of ideas and notes about the project.

- Make an Activity class to encompass activities like pool time and playground time.

- Attached rectangles need to move each other recursively.
    - Maybe use a graph-like system to store attached rectangles.

- Create a menu screen to navigate different camp-related functions of the program.
    - Activity scheduler
    - Room chart maker
    - Extended care roster
    - Email generator

- Use a machine learning algorithm to automate creating schedules and room charts.
